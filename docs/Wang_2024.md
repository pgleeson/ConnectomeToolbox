**Summary**

- The study presents the most extensive and accurate neurotransmitter atlas of _C. elegans_ to date, using CRISPR/Cas9-engineered fluorescent knock-in reporter alleles for 16 key neurotransmitter-related genes across both hermaphrodite and male nervous systems.

- Many neurons were found to express more than one neurotransmitter system, indicating that co-transmission is far more widespread than previously recognized and challenging the traditional one neuronâ€“one transmitter model.

- The researchers identified numerous previously unrecognized sites of neurotransmitter gene expression, not only in additional neurons but also in non-neuronal cells such as glia and gonadal cells, suggesting broader roles for neurotransmitter signalling.

- The study revealed substantial sexual dimorphism in neurotransmitter expression, including sex-specific usage in male-specific neurons and differential expression patterns in shared neurons, highlighting how neurotransmitter deployment contributes to sexually distinct neural function.
